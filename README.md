#Meteor GapIt: Client Smart-package

**Alpha. Work in progress.**

This component of Meteor GapIt is a client-side smart package that ensures your app can perform hot-reloads without losing access to the PhoneGap API.

This smart-package will only function when your Meteor app is loaded within the context of a GapIt-enabled PhoneGap/Cordova application.

##Installation

    $ mrt add gapit-client

That's it!
